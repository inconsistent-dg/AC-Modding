# Yo waddup!
[**ac-modding.com**](https://ac-modding.com/) is a website for anything that has to do with, you guessed it, Animal Crossing modding. 

You can follow my tutorial on [setting up Switch CFW](switch-guide), as you will need it to mod the game. If you already have a modded switch, [follow my modding series](ACNH/mods) to mod the game.

Some guides aren't specific to Animal Crossing, like the [SysDVR](SysDVR) guide, which can be used stream your Switch to PC without a capture card. You can [click here to look at a list of all available pages](219).

You've probably noticed I haven't been active in releasing modding content, given the last video was 1.5 years ago, and no new website content in almost 2. I'm just not as motivated as I used to be. 

There've been minor contributions from others (which I appreciate) but nothing in terms of new pages or sections. No title except for ACNH has any work on it, and there's missing content on existing pages, e.g. the NHSE page missing `Editing Field Items` content (how to use it, what can be done, etc.)

I put myself to a very high standard of what I produce, how my content is organized, and how in-depth I go into it, which often leads to burnout and procrastination on my part. My Music Mods video took 3 months to make because I wanted to capture footage of the Linux and MacOS installation (and virtualizing MacOS without buying a Mac is pretty hard). And the re-recording I had to do because of... issues, as well as the mods not working because... issues.

With all this said, I do still want to make modding content. I like editing and seeing the finished product. But the workload of figuring out the information, making a draft of the process, writing it in a concise way with images to help for the website, then scripting a video isn't easy, especially because of the unique way I edit. I don't do real-time recording like Klutch or [Pence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiVMKE5RiCA) even if it's slightly easier. Not digging at them just needed an example. 

All this to say, I'm hoping someone else is interested in contributing to the site. Whether it's expanding on current stuff or making new pages. There are many talented people that are still passionate about modding, and if you're willing to add content I encourage you to get in touch with me. Just shoot me a DM on Discord (@inconsistent_dg), or go through the other methods on my [contact page](https://ac-modding.com/contact), and I can give more info on how.
Thank you.
